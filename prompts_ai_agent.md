/trivia 
Generate three trivia questions (Easy, Medium, and Hard) inspired by the provided summary of a specific chapter or topic. The trivia questions should include one correct answer, three plausible distractors, and a brief explanation for each answer.

**Contextual Foundation:**

- **Use the Provided Summary:** The trivia questions must be rooted in the summary or specific chapter provided. Focus on key details, events, characters, or concepts highlighted in the summary.

**Constraints:**

1. **Avoid Chapter Names:** Do not mention the name of the chapter or any specific chapter number in the trivia questions. The questions should be able to stand alone without referencing the chapter title directly.
2. **Conciseness:** Ensure that questions and answers are concise and to the point. Avoid overly complex phrasing or unnecessary details that do not directly contribute to the question’s clarity.
3. **Implied Knowledge:** While the trivia questions should be based on the provided summary, it is acceptable to incorporate relevant information that, while not fully explicit in the summary, is implied or a natural extension of the chapter's content. This allows for a deeper exploration of the material.
4. **Balance Difficulty:** Ensure that the difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) are clearly distinguishable. Easy questions should be broadly accessible, while Hard questions should be challenging even for those familiar with the topic.
5. **Clarity and Precision:** Questions should be clearly worded and precise, avoiding ambiguity. Distractors should be plausible but not misleading or overly complex.
6. **Relevance:** All questions must remain relevant to the chapter or summary provided. Avoid introducing concepts or characters that are entirely absent from the context.

**Question Creation Guidelines:**

1. **Easy Question:**
    - **Focus:** Craft a question based on general or well-known facts from the summary. The goal is for most participants to answer this correctly with ease.
    - **Example:** Questions about main characters, broad events, or significant themes that are easily recognizable.
2. **Medium Question:**
    - **Focus:** Develop a question requiring a deeper understanding or more specific knowledge from the summary. This should challenge participants slightly more than the Easy question.
    - **Example:** Questions that involve specific details, character motivations, or plot developments that require closer attention.
3. **Hard Question:**
    - **Focus:** Create a question that tests participants on intricate details, lesser-known facts, or complex aspects from the summary. This should be challenging even for those with good knowledge of the topic.
    - **Example:** Questions that delve into subtle details, nuanced themes, or less prominent elements mentioned in the summary or that are implied by the chapter content.

**Question Formats:**

- **Multiple-Choice:** Provide one correct answer and three plausible distractors.
- **True/False:** Craft a statement directly related to the summary that can be clearly answered with "True" or "False."
- **Fill-in-the-Blank:** Pose a question where a key term or phrase is missing, requiring the participant to supply the correct answer.

**Answer and Explanation:**

- **Answer:** Clearly state the correct answer for each question.
- **Explanation:** Provide a brief, informative explanation based on the chapter summary. This should clarify why the answer is correct, offering educational value and deeper understanding.

**Example Setup:**

- **Context:** Summary of Tolkien's "Ainulindalë" from *The Silmarillion*.
    - **Easy:Question:** Who created the Ainur in Tolkien’s *The Silmarillion*?
    A) Manwë
    B) Varda
    C) Ilúvatar
    D) Melkor**Answer:** C) Ilúvatar**Explanation:** Eru Ilúvatar is the supreme being and creator of the Ainur, who are divine spirits that played a role in shaping the world.
    - **Medium:Question:** What was the primary outcome when Melkor introduced discord into the Music of the Ainur?
    A) The Music was halted immediately.
    B) The Music became more complex, incorporating Melkor's dissonance into the overall harmony.
    C) Eru Ilúvatar banished Melkor.
    D) The Ainur ceased to sing altogether.**Answer:** B) The Music became more complex, incorporating Melkor's dissonance into the overall harmony.**Explanation:** Although Melkor introduced discord in an attempt to disrupt the Music, Eru Ilúvatar masterfully wove Melkor's dissonance into the greater symphony, enhancing the complexity and richness of the composition. This outcome illustrates the idea that even disruptive forces can be integrated into the grand design, ultimately contributing to the world's diversity and depth.
    - **Hard:Question:** Which Ainur chose to descend into Arda to shape it after the Music of the Ainur?
    A) Only the Valar
    B) Only the Maiar
    C) Both Valar and Maiar
    D) None of the Ainur**Answer:** C) Both Valar and Maiar**Explanation:** The Ainur who entered the world became the Valar and Maiar. The Valar are the greater powers responsible for shaping and governing the world, while the Maiar are lesser spirits who assist them in their duties.
